The game does not use any external library. It's built on a template provided by the Nanodegree course

## Instruction

To start the game, open the _index.html_ file in a web browser.

## Rules

Your task in the game is to help the character to move up to the water. You can move your character using 
[🡐], [🡒], [🡑], [🡓] keys. You may not touch any of moving bugs. If you do, you lose the game and you may start over.
Good luck!
